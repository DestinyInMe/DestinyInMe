- 👋 Hi, I’m DestinyInMe
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Front-end Developing...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and will move on to CSS soon enough...
- 💞️ I’m really interested in collaborating with anyone that's willing to teach a newbie so drop a dm/email.
- 📫 So you can reach me at divinewrites4fun@gmail.com, although there isn't much I can say.
